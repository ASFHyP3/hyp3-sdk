and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0]
### Changed
- `Job.expired()` now returns `False` if `expiration_time` is `None`.

## [1.5.1]
### Changed
- Updated return type for `HyP3.check_quota()` to reflect the case where a user has no quota.

## [1.5.0]
### Added
- Added `processing_time_in_seconds` to `Job` class.
### Removed
- `hyp3_sdk.asf_search` has been removed and its functionality has been superseded by the
  [`asf_search`](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search) Python package, which provides a more comprehensive
  ASF search experience and is available on conda-forge and PyPI.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v1.4.1...v1.4.1)

### Fixed
- Slicing a `Batch` object will now return a new `Batch` instead of `list` of jobs
- `Batch` equality now compares the contained jobs and not object identity

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v1.3.2...v1.4.0)

### Added
- Exposed new `include_displacement_maps` parameter for `HyP3.prepare_insar_job` and `HyP3.submit_insar_job`, which will
  cause both a line-of-sight displacement and a vertical displacement GeoTIFF to be included in the product.

### Deprecated
- The `include_los_displacement` parameter of `HyP3.prepare_insar_job` and `HyP3.submit_insar_job` has been
  deprecated in favor of the `include_displacement_maps` parameter, and will be removed in the future.
- `hyp3_sdk.asf_search` is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
  Functionality has been superseded by the [`asf_search`](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search)
  Python package, which provides a more comprehensive ASF search experience and is available on conda-forge and PyPI.
  - instead of `hyp3_sdk.asf_search.get_metadata`, try `asf_search.granule_search` or `asf_search.product_search`
  - instead of `hyp3_sdk.asf_search.get_nearest_neighbors`, try `asf_search.baseline_search.stack_from_product` or `asf_search.baseline_search.stack_from_id`

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2)

### Added
- Exposed new `apply_water_mask` parameter for InSAR jobs in `HyP3.submit_insar_job()` and
  `HyP3.prepare_insar_job()`, which sets pixels over coastal waters and large inland waterbodies
                as invalid for phase unwrapping

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1)

### Added
- `extract_zipped_product` function to `hyp3_sdk.util` which will extract zipped HyP3 products

  - `hyp3_sdk.HyP3_PROD` is now `hyp3_sdk.PROD_API`
  - `hyp3_sdk.HyP3_TEST` is now `hyp3_sdk.TEST_API`

### Added
- `Job` class now has a `logs` attribute containing links to job log files
- Added missing [container methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types) 
  - batches are now subscriptable: `batch[0]`
  - jobs can be searched for in batches:`job in batch`
  - jobs can be deleted from batches: `del batch[0]`
  - batches can be reversed now using the `reversed()` function
- `find_jobs()` now accepts datetimes with no timezone info and defaults to UTC.

### Removed
- `FoundZeroJobs` warning from `find_jobs()`

### Fixed
- [#92](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/issues/92) -- `ImportError` being
  raised when showing a progress bar because `ipywidgets` may not always be
  installed when running in a Jupyter kernel
