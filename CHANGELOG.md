and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)

### Added
- A `dem_name` parameter has been added to `HyP3.submit_rtc_job` and `HyP3.prepare_rtc_job` to control which DEM data
  set is used for RTC processing
  - `dem_name='copernicus'` will use the [Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM](https://registry.opendata.aws/copernicus-dem/)
  - `dem_name='legacy'` will use the DEM with the best coverage from ASF's legacy SRTM/NED data sets

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v0.6.0...v1.0.0)

### Added
- `HyP3.find_jobs` now supports filtering by `job_type`
- `HyP3.find_jobs` now pages through truncated responses to get all requested jobs
- `hyp3_sdk.exceptions` now includes `ServerError` for exceptions that are a result of 
  system errors.

### Changed
- `hyp3_sdk.exceptions` now has `HyP3SDKError` as a module base exception, and `HyP3Error` is now specific
  errors in the `hyp3` submodule
- `HyP3.find_jobs` argument `status` renamed to `status_code` to be consistent with api-spec

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

### Added
- `asf_search` module will now raise an `exceptions.ASFSearchError` when it encounters problems and
  will include the Search API response details
- `HyP3.__init__` now accepts a `prompt=True` (default `False`) keyword argument
  which will prompt users for their username or password if not provided

### Changed
- HyP3 prepare and submit methods now include processing options as named parameters
- Exceptions raised for HyP3 errors will include the HyP3 API response details
- `asf_search.get_nearest_neighbors` is no longer dependent on state vector information in CMR
  - now limited to Sentinel-1 granules
  - now raises `ASFSearchError` when the reference granule cannot be found
  - results no longer include `perpendicularBaseline` or `temporalBaseline` fields

### Fixed
- `get_authenticated_session` now correctly throws `AuthenticationError` when no `.netrc` file
  exists and no credentials are provided


## [0.5.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)

### Added
- Methods to prepare jobs for submission to HyP3
  - `HyP3.prepare_autorift_job`
  - `HyP3.prepare_rtc_job`
  - `HyP3.prepare_insar_job`
- `HyP3.watch`, `Job.download_files`, and `Batch.download_files` now display progress bars
    
### Changed
- HyP3 `Job` objects provide a better string representation
  ```python
  >>> print(job)
  HyP3 RTC_GAMMA job dd884703-cdbf-47ff-848c-de1e2b9917c1
  ```

- HyP3 `Batch` objects
  - are now iterable
  - provide a better string representation
    ```python
    >>> print(batch)
    2 HyP3 Jobs: 0 succeeded, 0 failed, 2 running, 0 pending.
    ```

- HyP3 submit methods will always return a `Batch` containing the submitted job(s)
- `HyP3.submit_job_dict` has been renamed to `HyP3.submit_prepared_jobs` and can
  submit one or more prepared job dictionaries.
- `Job.download_files` and `Batch.download_files` will (optionally) create the
  download location if it doesn't exist
- `Hyp3._get_job_by_id` has been made public and renamed to `Hyp3.get_job_by_id`

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v0.3.3...v0.4.0)

### Added
- `hyp3_sdk.asf_search` module to find granule(s) metadata, and a granule's nearest neighbors for InSAR

### Added
- SDK will attach a `User-Agent` statement like `hyp3_sdk/VERSION` to all API interactions

### Changed
- Providing a job list to `Batch.__init__()` is now optional; an empty batch will 
  be created if the job list is not provided
- `Batch.__init__()` no longer issues a warning when creating an empty batch
- `HyP3.find_jobs()` will now issue a warning when a zero jobs were found

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2)

### Changed
